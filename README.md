# Cal_PnP



## Note

I used the command

```
g++ -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv@3/3.4.16_5/include/ -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv@3/3.4.16_5/lib -g -o bin ./src/main.cpp ./src/Cfg.cpp ./src/CamCal.cpp -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_calib3d -lm
```

to compile.





This repository contains our C++ implementation of semi-automatic camera calibration based on Perspective-n-Point (PnP). It can be used to compute the homography matrix and manually correct radial distortion. 

## Introduction

This package is designed for computing camera homography matrix. The input includes a set of 3D points on the 3D ground plane and the corresponding 2D pixel points. We adopt the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) for camera calibration. The user can choose from different approaches such as (1) a regular method using all the points, (2) RANSAC-based robust method or (3) Least-Median robust method. The package also includes tools for manual 2D points selection. 

## Coding Structure

1. `./obj/` folder: Libraries of .cpp files
2. `./src/` folder: Source code
3. `./data/` folder: Example input files
   1. `cfg.json`: Configuration parameters in JSON format
   2. `frm.jpg`: Input frame image

## How to Build

1. Download and make the OpenCV library. A tutorial is given [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).
2. Compile using g++ in Linux environment. If you are new to g++ compilation with OpenCV, please refer to this [link](http://answers.opencv.org/question/25642/how-to-compile-basic-opencv-program-in-c-in-ubuntu/). In the command window, you can `cd` to the directory of `./Cal_PnP/` and use the following command to compile our source code, where `bin` is the executable file generated. Note that you may need to add `sudo` at the beginning to grant the admin permission.

   ```
   g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -L/usr/local/lib/ -g -o bin ./src/main.cpp ./src/Cfg.cpp ./src/CamCal.cpp -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_calib3d -lm
   ```


## How to Use
1. Set the corresponding input/output paths in the configuration file if necessary. 
2. Provide the coordinates of **at least 4** 3D points on the ground plane (or any plane of interest) at `cal3dPtLs`. One way is to find the GPS coordinates using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

3. If the user wants to select the corresponding 2D pixel points on the image, set `calSel2dPtFlg` to 1. A new window called `selector of 2D points` pops out. The user can click on the image to select each 2D point. A blue circle stands for each click. After the selection is done, click `o`. Please make sure the number of selected 2D points should be the same as the provided 3D points (in the same order). During the selection, if mis-clicking on wrong places, the user can press `r`. All the markers will be cleared, and s/he can start over.

4. If there exists radial distortion, the frame image can be manually corrected by by setting `calDistFlg` to 1 and providing the distortion coefficients (`calDistCoeff`) and intrinsic camera parameters (`calFocLen` and `calPrinPt`). 
5. The user can choose to use different methods for camera calibration by setting `calTyp`, whose introduction is at this [link](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#findhomography). Note that when using RANSAC-based robust method, the threshold parameter needs to be provided at  `calRansacReprojThld`. When setting `calTyp` as -1, all the methods will be conducted and evaluated, the one with the minimum reprojection error will be chosen. 
6. The output text file shows the 3x3 homography matrix at the first line. If the correction of radial distortion is conducted, the 3x3 intrinsic parameter matrix and 1x4 distortion coefficients are also printed. Finally, the reprojection error in pixels is printed as well. 
7. The user can choose to output the display image (with a colorful grid on the 3D plane) by setting `outCalDispFlg` to 1. The blue circles show the input 2D pixel points. The red circles show the corresponding points back projected from 3D. The distance between their centers indicates the reprojection error.

8. Run the executable file.

   ```
   ./bin
   ```
